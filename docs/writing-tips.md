# Guide on Guides

A guide is any article we write that intends to help out another Pitt CS student.

We consider a page that includes useful information to be a 'guide'. It can be short, like "How to become a TA", or it can be a series,
like "Zero to Offer".

Some guides are more structured, and deserve their own folder. Like, the `Zero to Offer` set.

We write them in Markdown.

To add a guide, open a PR, and create an appropiate markdown file in the `srcs/guides` folder.

## Guiding Principles

(Pun Intended)

We keep these things in mind when writing guides:

- Brief
- Unbiased
- Quality

We aim for brevity.

We try our best to be unbiased and profressional, and we add
disclaimers because at the end of the day we are just college students and do
not really know what we are talking about.

And, we try to maintain a high quality bar by having our content reviewed
by other members.

## How does this all work?

When you add a new markdown file to `src/guides`, GatsbyJS (the framework we use), will automatically create a webpage, and transform your markdown into HTML. More information can be found by following this Gatsby tutorial if you wish to learn more - https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/.

If you want to make a guide with interactive components - read how you can do that [here](/docs/how-to-create-an-interactive-guide.md).
